# Kinsta Web Developer Code Challenge

This code challenge is designed to assess a candidate's skills in PHP and frontend development.

## Instructions

The code challenge is divided into two sections: a PHP Development challenge and a Frontend Development challenge.

Each challenge has a set of core requirements and a set of bonus or optional requirements. Candidates are expected to complete the core requirements of each challenge. We ask that you complete the core requirements first and then move on to the optional bonus requirements as time allows. The bonus requirements are not required to complete the challenge but are there to give candidates an opportunity to showcase their skills and creativity. You may choose to complete as many or as few of the bonus requirements as you like.

### Challenge 1: PHP Development

In this challenge, candidates will create a PHP class to interact with a list of books stored in a JSON file. The PHP class should provide several methods for interacting with the list of books, such as adding a book, deleting a book, updating a book, and retrieving a book by ID.

#### Challenge Details & Files

- [challenge-1.md](./challenge-1.md): The file that outlines the requirements of the backend challenge.
- [data/books.json](./data/books.json): A JSON file containing the list of books that the PHP class should interact with.

### Challenge 2: Frontend Development

In this challenge, candidates will create a frontend application that interacts with the list of books from Challenge 1. The frontend should allow users to view the list of books, add new books, search and filter books.

A [Design Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/9jMci6xwgORWWgAEBeXTnl/BookzRUs-Mockup?node-id=0%3A1&t=W4BIRXDOoLRu3oFM-1) is available to assist with the implementation of the frontend challenge. Although we would appreciate seeing candidates implement as much of the design as possible, we recognize that time is a limitation. Therefore, we request that candidates first focus on the design elements that align with the core requirements of the challenge and then gradually improve the UI as time permits. We do not require candidates to change the design, however they are free to make adjustments to the UI implementation to ensure things like accessibility and mobile responsiveness.

#### Challenge Details & Files

- [challenge-2.md](./challenge-2.md): The file that outlines the requirements of the frontend challenge.
- [data/books.json](./data/books.json): The same JSON file containing the list of books from Challenge 1.
- [Figma Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/9jMci6xwgORWWgAEBeXTnl/BookzRUs-Mockup?node-id=0%3A1&t=W4BIRXDOoLRu3oFM-1): Figma design mockup that you can as a reference to build the UI.

## Submission

Candidates can submit their solutions by uploading a zip file of their code or by creating a **private repository** on GitHub and inviting the hiring team to access it. The submission should include all the necessary files and instructions on how to run the code.

Please keep in mind that candidates will be assessed on their understanding of their submissions during the interview process. They should be prepared to walk through their solution with the hiring team and be able to answer any questions about decisions they made on the implementation.

Good luck!
