# Kinsta Web Developer Code Challenge

This code challenge is designed to assess a candidate's skills in PHP and frontend development. The challenge is divided into two sections: a PHP Development challenge and a Frontend Development challenge.

## Challenge 1: PHP Development

In this challenge, candidates will create a PHP class to interact with a list of books stored in a JSON file. The PHP class should provide several methods for interacting with the list of books, such as adding a book, deleting a book, updating a book, and retrieving a book by ID.

### Instruction & Files

- [challenge-1.md](./challenge-1.md): The file that outlines the requirements of the backend challenge.
- [data/books.json](./data/books.json): A JSON file containing the list of books that the PHP class should interact with.

## Challenge 2: Frontend Development

In this challenge, candidates will create a frontend application that interacts with the list of books from Challenge 1. The frontend should allow users to view the list of books, add new books, search and filter books.

### Instruction & Files

- [challenge-2.md](./challenge-2.md): The file that outlines the requirements of the frontend challenge.
- [data/books.json](./data/books.json): The same JSON file containing the list of books from Challenge 1.

## Submission

Candidates can submit their solutions by uploading a zip file of their code or by creating a **private repository** on GitHub and inviting the hiring team to access it. The submission should include all the necessary files and instructions on how to run the code.

Please keep in mind that candidates will be assessed on their understanding of their submissions during the interview process. They should be prepared to walk through their solution with the hiring team and be able to answer any questions about decisions they made on the implementation.

Good luck!
